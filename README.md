# About this Project

Are you a writer who need names for your characters? Why not try out this random name generator I whipped up?

Names can currently be generated using US Census and Social Security baby naming data. At some point in the future I'll get around to integrating additional datasets.

Currently deployed at [`https://random-name-generators-svelte.pages.dev/`](https://random-name-generators-svelte.pages.dev/).
